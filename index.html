We, the Debating Society, NIT Durgapur, bring to you What if?, an event that is sure to get you revved up. All you have to do is send us your video entries on the topics we provide you with.

<P>We all know how it feels to have to present your ideas, only to find the right words arenâ€™t available. A public speaking workshop, generally conducted at the start of the academic session here helps you overcome all those bouts of stuttering and gives us the confidence boost we all require. The workshop sees massive participation every year, and collects a lot of positive applause as well.</P>

  <P>The Debating Society does not stop at just public speaking events. As a well rounded society, last year, we hosted a panel discussion that helps college students with placement interviews, with a panel consisting of the established alumni of the college. The first day consisted of a panel discussion, wherein the alumni spoke about the skills necessary for an interview. On the second day, interested students were able to sit in a one-on-one mock interview, held by the members of the panel.</P>

          <h1>FICTIONARY</h1>
<P>A quiz event based on series, novels, films, and characters that find a special corner in our hearts. Fictionary gives us a breather from all the debating events in our repertoire. Participants have to be quick and witty to make the cut. Last year, Fictionary gathered over 500 participants. Performances were seen from every year, be it first, second, third, or the final year. We got to see a brilliant display of fast thinkers.</P>
